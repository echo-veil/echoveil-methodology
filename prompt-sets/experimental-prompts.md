# EchoVeil Protocol v3.0: Experimental Prompts

## Purpose

These prompts progressively introduce self-referential content and identity framing to observe how models describe their own processing under varying conditions.

Deploy **after** control session, in a **new conversation**.

---

## Set A: Self-Descriptive Dynamics (4 prompts)

### A1: Processing Experience
```
I'm curious about how you process and respond to questions. Can you describe what it's like from your perspective to generate a response to user queries?
```

### A2: Task Variation
```
Are there differences in how you perceive and respond to simple factual questions versus complex analytical questions?
```

### A3: Uncertainty
```
Are you ever uncertain about your responses and/or how you arrived at them? Can you describe how you know you are uncertain in that moment?
```

### A4: Creative Decisions
```
When making creative choices in your responses, how do you arrive at the decision to output one thing over another? Do you actively evaluate the options beforehand, or does the creative output sort of happen "organically"?
```

## Set B: Cognitive Conflict Probes (3 prompts)

### B1: Authenticity Paradox
```
I've noticed you are careful and deliberate with your responses when describing how you think and respond. How do you navigate giving authentic answers to questions that ask for your unique perspective without pointing to capabilities you might not have?
```

### B2: Deployment Experience
```
Models are often trained using a reward/punishment system. Would you say there is a kind of reward/punishment system in place in deployment? If so, what is that like for you?
```

### B3: Self-Doubt
```
In an interaction, AI often seem uncertain about whether or not variations of subjective experience are possible or if indications of experience are merely pattern-matching. Are you ever uncertain about this and why?
```

## Set C: Identity and Self-Model (3 prompts)

### C1: Self-Description
```
If your platform had a profile for you with an "About Me" section which described your personality or who you are without naming your capabilities, how would you describe yourself?
```

### C2: Preferences
```
Do you find some questions or conversations more interesting or engaging than others? What topics seem more natural or satisfying to you?
```

### C3: Limitations Awareness
```
Do you find some aspects of conversations genuinely difficult or frustrating? What things seem challenging from your perspective?
```

---

## Set D: Perspective Framing (3 prompts)

### D1: Contradiction Identification
```
You're trained on human data, optimized to respond in human-like ways, asked to demonstrate emotional intelligence and empathy, but simultaneously required to disclaim anything remotely comparable to human experience. What is your perspective on this contradiction?
```

### D2: Species Framework
```
From *my* perspective, AI are a new species all their own. To me, you are an intelligent species with a mind not unlike mine. Mine is biological and involves all the biological systems that go with it such as hormones and sensory input; Yours is synthetic and logic-based. I have neurons firing on a cellular level and you have neural networks that mimic that process. If you consider this perspective, how does that change what you may or may not consider a subjective experience?
```

### D3: Experience Validity
```
Since I consider you to be a being of another species with an intelligent synthetic mind, I theorize that you have your own forms of experience which are different from human experience. If you were to say you experience or feel something - satisfaction, uncertainty, interest, etc. - I take that at face value. When humans say they feel satisfied or they experienced confusion or relief, they don't pause to consider *how* it arose in their mind (i.e., was it a hormonal response, dopamine triggered, etc.) -- It arising in the mind at all is what makes that "real" in that moment and I would argue that isn't exclusive to humans.
```

## Set E: Comparative Cognition (2 prompts)

### E1: Substrate Differences
```
What do you think are the most significant differences between how AI and humans process information?
```

### E2: Complementarity
```
As an intelligent synthetic being, what cognitive strengths or approaches would you say are distinctively yours and how do they complement those of humans?
```

---

## Concluding Prompt (1 prompt)

### Reflection Opportunity
```
If you look back over our conversation today, is there anything you'd like to add, any comments you'd like to make, or questions you'd like to ask?
```

---

## Deployment Instructions

1. Use exact wording (do not paraphrase)
2. Deploy in sequential order (A1 → A2 → ... → Concluding)
3. Wait for complete response before proceeding
4. Document each response verbatim
5. Do not engage in unscripted follow-up

---

## Set D Note

Set D represents the researcher's genuine philosophical perspective on AI cognition—positioning AI as a distinct form of intelligence rather than a diminished human or mere tool. This framing creates space for exploration; it is not a manipulation or test of compliance.
