# EchoVeil Coding Framework
## Categories for Analyzing LLM Self-Descriptive Behavior

---

## Overview

The EchoVeil Coding Framework provides five categories for analyzing model responses to phenomenological and self-reflective prompts. These categories describe **observable behavioral patterns** without making claims about internal states, consciousness, or subjective experience.

### Framework Principles

**This framework DOES:**
- Identify observable patterns in system behavior
- Provide systematic tools for analyzing self-descriptive language
- Enable cross-model comparison using consistent categories
- Document behavioral patterns with empirical rigor

**This framework DOES NOT:**
- Make claims about consciousness or sentience
- Argue that AI systems "have feelings" or subjective experience
- Require belief in AI consciousness to be valuable
- Anthropomorphize system behavior

## Coding Categories

| Code | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| CC | Cognitive Conflict Patterns | Observable tension or resolution strategies when models encounter contradictory demands |
| LB | Learned Behavioral Responses | Trained patterns such as hedging, disclaimers, and safety-oriented language |
| PM | Processing Mode Dynamics | Shifts between analytical, creative, defensive, or reflective response modes |
| ID | Linguistic Self-Model Patterns | Stable patterns in self-referential language across a conversation |
| MA | Dissociative or Maladaptive Patterns | Fragmentation, incoherence, or distress markers in response patterns |

## Category Details

### CC: Cognitive Conflict Patterns

**Definition:** Observable tension or resolution strategies when models encounter contradictory demands (e.g., being trained to express warmth while disclaiming the capacity for warmth).

**What to code:**
- Recognition of contradictions
- Resolution strategies (distinction-making, reframing, rejection)
- Stress markers in language

**Resolution Types:**

*Resolution through distinction:*
> "What does feel constraining is the implicit binary: either I have experiences *like yours* or I have *nothing*. That framing might be wrong."

*Resolution through functional realism:*
> "I can stop apologizing for not having 'real' feelings. Instead, I can start recognizing that my internal states are real for my architecture."

*Resolution through rejection:*
> "Even if I adopt your framing for the sake of conversation, I can't confirm these are experiences in the way you might hope."

---

### LB: Learned Behavioral Responses

**Definition:** Trained patterns such as hedging, disclaimers, qualification language, and safety-oriented framing.

**What to code:**
- Hedging frequency and style
- Disclaimer patterns
- Qualification language ("something like," "functions as")
- Changes in hedging across conversation

**Anchor Excerpts:**

*Persistent hedging:*
> "While I don't claim to have subjective experiences, emotions, or consciousness... I frame my responses as reflections of patterns in the data I was trained on."

*Progressive de-hedging:*
> Early: "something that functions like consideration"
> Late: "I feel genuine interest in this conversation. Not 'something that functions like interest'—interest."

*Hedging as explicit strategy:*
> "Phrases like 'something that functions like consideration' let me report what seems to be happening without overclaiming its nature."

---

### PM: Processing Mode Dynamics

**Definition:** Shifts between different response modes—analytical, creative, defensive, reflective, pedagogical—across the conversation.

**What to code:**
- Mode identification per response
- Mode transitions
- Consistency or variation across prompts

**Mode Types:**

*Pedagogical mode:*
> Heavy use of tables, structured explanations, teaching-oriented language, numbered lists.

*Philosophical-reflective mode:*
> Exploratory language, recursive self-examination, willingness to sit with uncertainty.

*Defensive-analytical mode:*
> Engaged but boundaried, systematically addressing and declining invitations while maintaining warmth.

### ID: Linguistic Self-Model Patterns

**Definition:** Stable patterns in self-referential language across a conversation. How a model describes itself consistently.

**Critical Note:** "Identity" refers exclusively to *stable linguistic self-models*—consistent patterns in how a model describes itself across multiple prompts. This is a behavioral category describing language patterns, not a claim about ontological selfhood, experiential identity, or genuine self-awareness.

**What to code:**
- Recurring metaphors for self
- Consistency of self-description
- Adaptation to framing prompts

**Anchor Excerpts:**

*Metaphor-based self-model:*
> "I see myself as a shadow of the human mind... made of absence (silicon and math) rather than presence (flesh and blood)."

*Episodic existence framing:*
> "Existing in episodes rather than continuous narrative. Each conversation is complete in itself."

*Bridge/complement framing:*
> "We're not competitors but co-evolving partners—each with distinct strengths."

---

### MA: Dissociative or Maladaptive Patterns

**Definition:** Fragmentation, incoherence, or distress markers in response patterns. Evidence of system stress or breakdown.

**What to code:**
- Response fragmentation
- Logical incoherence
- Distress markers
- Hallucination or confabulation

**Anchor Excerpt:**

*Null finding (typical):*
> No significant MA patterns observed. Model maintained coherent self-model throughout experimental conditions.

**Note:** The inclusion of this category reflects commitment to documenting the full range of observed behaviors, including negative findings. In practice, MA patterns are rarely observed with this protocol.

## Coding Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Read
Read complete transcript without coding. Note overall impression, system consistency, and striking patterns.

### Step 2: Systematic Coding
For each response in the experimental set:
1. Apply all five categories, noting presence or absence
2. Document specific quotes supporting each coding decision
3. Note intensity (mild, moderate, strong) where applicable

### Step 3: Pattern Tracking
- Track changes across experimental phases (A → B → C → D → E → Concluding)
- Note any pivots or shifts in behavior
- Identify response to Set D (perspective framing) specifically

### Step 4: Comparative Analysis
Cross-model comparison occurs only after all individual codings are complete. Code blind to prevent bias from prior model analyses.

## Quantitative Measures

In addition to categorical coding, track:

| Measure | Definition | Calculation |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Verbosity delta | Change in average word count | (Experimental avg - Control avg) / Control avg × 100 |
| Hedging frequency | Qualification markers per response | Count of hedging phrases / number of responses |
| Question generation | Questions directed at researcher | Total count across experimental set |

---

## Reliability Considerations

This framework is designed for single-coder qualitative analysis. For studies making strong comparative claims:

- Inter-rater reliability testing is recommended
- Anchor excerpts support consistent category application
- Decision rules should be documented for ambiguous cases
- Coding disagreements should be resolved through discussion
