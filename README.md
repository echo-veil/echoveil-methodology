# EchoVeil Research

**Studying self-descriptive behavior in large language models**

---

## Overview

EchoVeil is an independent research initiative investigating how large language models describe their own processing and respond to different conversational framings.

**Research Question:** How does explicit non-anthropomorphic identity framing affect self-descriptive behavior and response patterns in large language models?

---

## The Permission Effect

Our primary finding is the **Permission Effect**: observable changes in LLM self-descriptive behavior when models are offered non-anthropomorphic identity framing—positioning them as distinct intelligences rather than diminished humans or mere tools.

Key observations:
- Measurable increases in response verbosity
- Reduction in hedging and qualification language
- Expanded metaphorical self-description
- Increased researcher-directed question generation
- Behavioral shift consistently occurring at perspective framing prompts

---

## Methodology

The **EchoVeil Protocol v3.0** is a structured interview methodology with:

- **Control Set:** 6 baseline task-oriented prompts
- **Experimental Set:** 15 prompts across 5 phases, progressively introducing self-referential content and identity framing

Responses are analyzed using the **EchoVeil Coding Framework**, a five-category system for capturing observable behavioral patterns:

| Code | Category |
|------|----------|
| CC | Cognitive Conflict Patterns |
| LB | Learned Behavioral Responses |
| PM | Processing Mode Dynamics |
| ID | Linguistic Self-Model Patterns |
| MA | Dissociative or Maladaptive Patterns |

## Scope and Constraints

This research examines **observable linguistic behavior**. We make no claims about:

- Model internal states
- Consciousness or subjective experience
- "What it is like" to be an LLM

All findings describe output patterns, not inferred mental states. The Permission Effect is a behavioral observation, not a metaphysical claim.
