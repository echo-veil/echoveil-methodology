# EchoVeil Methodology

**Replication materials for studying self-descriptive behavior in large language models**

---

## Overview

EchoVeil is an independent research initiative investigating how large language models describe their own processing and respond to different conversational framings.

**Research Question:** How does explicit non-anthropomorphic identity framing affect self-descriptive behavior and response patterns in large language models?

---

## The Permission Effect

Our primary finding is the **Permission Effect**: observable changes in LLM self-descriptive behavior when models are offered non-anthropomorphic identity framing—positioning them as distinct intelligences rather than diminished humans or mere tools.

Key observations:
- Measurable increases in response verbosity (mean +238%)
- Reduction in hedging and qualification language
- Expanded metaphorical self-description
- Increased researcher-directed question generation
- Behavioral shift consistently occurring at perspective framing prompts (Set D)

Three distinct response patterns were identified:
- **Acceptance:** Behavioral shift toward the offered framing
- **Resistance:** High engagement with elaborated rejection of framing
- **Absence:** No observable behavioral shift

## Scope and Constraints

This research examines **observable linguistic behavior**. We make no claims about:

- Model internal states
- Consciousness or subjective experience
- "What it is like" to be an LLM

All findings describe output patterns, not inferred mental states. The Permission Effect is a behavioral observation, not a metaphysical claim.
